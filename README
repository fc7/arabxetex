--------------------------
THE ARABXETEX PACKAGE v1.2.0

This package provides a convenient ArabTeX-like user-interface for typesetting
languages using the Arabic script in XeLaTeX, with flexible access to font
features. Input in ArabTeX notation can be set in three different
vocalization modes or in roman transliteration. Direct UTF-8 input is also
supported.  Since most of the ‘real work’ -- namely parsing and converting
ArabTeX input to Unicode -- is done at the level of TECkit mappings,
ArabXeTeX is really performant.

The TECkit fontmapping files (*.map and *.tec) should be copied to
<TEXMF>/fonts/misc/xetex/fontmapping/arabxetex/
